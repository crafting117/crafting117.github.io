## Getting Started ðŸš€

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) to be installed on your computer. 
```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/crafting117/crafting117.github.io
```

If you don't have Git installed or you don't like using the terminal then you can download the [zip](https://github.com/crafting117/crafting117.github.io.zip) and extract that and open the extracted folder in the code editor of your your choice.
